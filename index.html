      <blockquote><em>“Let us think the unthinkable, let us do the undoable. Let us prepare to grapple with the
          ineffable itself, and see if we may not eff it after&nbsp;all.”</em></blockquote>
      <p>Goals are powerful and universal. They're the fuel for all of humanity’s great accomplishments, and helping
        people achieve their most outlandish goals is our highest calling. We now have the technology and
        understanding to help people achieve them faster and with fewer resources. I’m starting a company that will
        do just that through a combination of machine learning (AI), concierge-like services and a lot of hard work.
      </p>
      <p>This is a big, nebulous goal. There’s a lot of mud to crawl through to get there. But it will be worth it
        (and a hell of a lot of fun).
      </p>
      <p>If you're interested, fill out the survey below and let’s see if we may not eff it after all.</p>

      <p>If you’ve found this, it’s likely because you’re searching for information about this idea. Keith Rabois has mentioned goal achievement in several podcasts and on Quora.</p>
      <p>Here's a list of resources where Keith has discussed this idea:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.quora.com/session/Keith-Rabois/2" target="_blank">Quora Session with Keith Rabois</a></li>
        <li>OFF RCRD Podcast ep2 w/Keith Rabois - <a href="https://medium.com/@cory/keith-rabois-on-off-rcrd-with-cory-levy-take-1-interview-transcript-b2a5ffbeffa5" target="_blank">Transcript</a>, <a href="https://offrcrd.com/episodes/keith-rabois/">Audio</a> (note: Transcript differs from audio)
        <li>Venture Stories by Erik Torenberg with Keith Rabois - <a href="https://player.fm/series/venture-stories/what-keith-rabois-thinks-about-basically-everything" target="_blank">Audio</a> (@ 64:30), <a href="https://podcastnotes.org/2019/03/05/rabois-5/" target="_blank">Podcast Notes</a>
      </ul>
      <h3>The Idea</h3>
      <p>There are two versions of the idea that Keith has discussed: general goals and fitness-specific goals. Both would be highly personalized and vertically integrated, meaning they own multiple pieces of the value chain (e.g. tracking software, training services and food). The former idea is broader (horizontal) and far more difficult. The latter (fitness) could be a wedge into the former, because it's a top-tier problem in most peoples' lives and rarely works when not integrated.
     </p>
      <p>In my opinion, perhaps the most difficult piece of helping people achieve long-term goals is replacing faith with a tight feedback loop. For example, progress in fitness is generally slow, which makes it easy to lose interest. Weight loss takes weeks or months, and improving at fitness-capacity-related tests takes a month or so. Blood testing provides some insight, but it's prohibitively annoying and expensive, so we're left with a <a href="https://jerryoftheday.net/blogs/best-of-jerry-of-the-day/huck-and-pray" target="_blank">huck-and-pray</a> (faith-based) system that uses box-checking as a proxy for measurable progress. Unsurprisingly, people often quit.</p>
